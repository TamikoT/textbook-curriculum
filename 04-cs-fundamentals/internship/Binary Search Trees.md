## Optional offline Problem Sets
+ Print all values in a Binary Search Tree using In-order, Pre-order, Post-order traversal using an iterative solution. Assume you are provided a Stack/Queue data structure that can contain the tree Node pointer or reference.
+ Print all values in a BST in breadth first traversal order
+ Convert a given integer array e.g. {5,2,1,6,7,3,4} to a Binary Search Tree. Challenge: Ensure that the tree is balanced.
+ Find the height of a BST using an iterative solution.
+ Given 2 Binary Trees (not BST), return true if both trees have the same in-order else return false. Note: You can save in-order from both trees and compare in the end (try implementing this as well). Can you inorder traverse them parallely and stop the traversal on a mismatch to return false instead?

## In Class
Here's the problems we'll cover in class. Design and implement code for functions to do the following:
+ 1. Delete a given value from a Binary Search Tree using recursive solution.
+ 2. Print all values in a Binary Tree using Pre-order, Post-order and In-order traversals. Implement each solution recursively.
+ 3. Find the height of Binary Tree. Implement the recursive solution.
+ 4. Insert a given value in a Binary Search Tree. Implement recursive solution.
+ 5. Find a given value in a Binary Search Tree. Implement recursive solution. </br>

<b>Note</b>: Assume each Node in the tree has integer data and links to the left Node and the right Node. </br>
