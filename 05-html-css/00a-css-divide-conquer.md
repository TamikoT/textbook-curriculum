# Divide and Conquer:
Include a few useful values, as well as any shorthand that's applicable
- text-align, text-transform, and text-decoration
- padding v margin
- border and border-radius, color v background-color
- font-size, font-weight, line-height, font-style
- font-family (web-safe fonts, descending priority, font shorthand)
- display (block, inline, inline-block, none)
