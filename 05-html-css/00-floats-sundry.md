# Intro To Position: Floats

But first, a couple of sundries.

## Colors

CSS colors are all made by mixing different levels of red, green, and blue, though there are multiple ways to represent this.

- The value can be done a few ways:

  ###Hex
  `p {color: #ff0000}`

    - Hex color starts with `#` and has 3 or 6 characters. These characters represent the red, green, and blue channels.
    - Heximal is base 16, meaning all characters used are either 0-9 or a-f, representing an amount of red, green, or blue. 0 means no color (black), f means the most color (white).
    - The first two characters correspond to red, the middle to to green, and the last to to blue.

  ###RGB
  `p {color: rgba(255,0,0);}`

    - RGB accepts three comma-separated values, each of which is an integer from 0 to 255. 0 is pure black, 255 is white.

  ###RGBA
  `p {color: rgba(255,0,0,0);}`
    - Same as RGB, except it adds opacity.
    - The fourth value is between 0 and 1, with 0 being transparent and 1 being fully opaque.

  ###Keyword Colors###
  `p {color:red;}`
    - Keyword colors map to a specific color in the CSS spec
    - Easy to use, but limited, so not used as frequently

There are a number of color pickers online for hex and rgb colors, as well as sites that will convert color values.

## The Box Model
Every element on the page is a rectangular box and many properties determine its size: size of the core box, padding, border, and margin.

Important: The sizes of padding, border, and margin _add to_ the defined size of the core box. You can use the `box-sizing` property to get around this.

```css
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```


## Positioning With Floats

### What Floats Do
- Floating an object takes it out of the normal flow of the HTML.
- Elements can only be floated left or right, and cannot be centered with floats.
- Floated boxes will move to the left or right until their outer edge touches the containing block edge or the outer edge of another float.
- The elements after the floating element will flow around it.
- The elements before the floating element will not be affected.

#### Syntax
`selector {float: value;}`
Possible values are `left`, `right`, `none`.


### Clearing Floats
When you want other content from flowing around the floated items, apply the `clear` property to the element you want to not flow around floated items.


#### Syntax
`selector {clear: value;}`
Possible values are `left`, `right`, `both`, or `none`.

### Clearfix

When a container box has only floated elements in it, the container height collapses to zero. Since floated boxes are taken out of the flow and donâ€™t affect the parent box, there is nothing to give height to the container. If you want a border or background around your floated elements, this will cause problems.

The workaround for this is called a clearfix. This small block of css applies a tiny bit of hidden content after the parent element. This clears the float and allows the container to expand. To implement it, add a `clearfix` class to the parent element, and add the following to your stylesheet.

```css
.clearfix:after {
content: "";
display: block;
clear: both;
}
```
