# Session & Flash

## Learning Goals
- Learn about and utilize `flash` in Rails
- Learn about and utilize `session` in Rails
- See how `session` & `flash` are different than other variables in Rails

## `flash`
`flash` is a special type of hash that we utilize to send one-time messages from controllers to our views. It is often used to denote overall success or failure when submitting forms. `flash` messages are used a single time, and once they are displayed once they are gone.

The scenario that we are going to use to utilize `flash` is when we are adding a new book. Previously, we added the new book to the database and then used `redirect_to` to go back to the book list page. We want to add some sort of notice to the book list page to inform the user that their new book has been added successfully. Let's take a lot at our `create` method as it exists right now.
```ruby
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb
  def create
    @book = Book.create book_params

    if @book.id != nil
      redirect_to books_path
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
```

Let's update this controller action to add a key-value pair in the `flash` hash to contain a message that we want to display on the book list page when a book has been successfully added.

```ruby
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb
  def create
    @book = Book.create book_params

    if @book.id != nil
      flash[:success] = "Book added successfully"
      redirect_to books_path
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
```

Now let's test it out to see if this will be displayed somewhere on our book list page after successful creation. Any luck? No!

As with all variables that we set in our controller actions, the way we get this data to display to our users is to put it in a view! Since we can use `flash` in many different contexts, we will add this to our `application.html.erb` view so that any controller action will be able to use this in the future (though you can add this to any view you'd like).

```erb
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
...
<body>
  <section class="flash">
    <% flash.each do |name, message| %>
      <div class="<%= name %>"><%= message %></div>
    <% end %>
  </section>

  <%= yield %>
</body>
```

This view code will also dynamically add a `class` to the message `div` so that we can add any distinguishing styles to these flash messages.

Now let's see what we end up with!

### `flash.now`

The above example works because right after we set the `flash` value in the controller, we are doing a `redirect_to`. If we want to use a `flash` but with a `render` instead of a `redirect_to` then we need to use `flash.now` instead. The different usage is solely based on what comes next. `flash.now` will only stick around going to a `render` and `flash` will stick around going to a `redirect`.

## `session`
`session` is another special type of hash-like-object that we utilize to keep track of data throughout a users "session", which normally ends when they close their browser. It is similar to `params` in that it is something special that Rails creates for us. It is different because it persists from one one request to another. It is most often used to store information about a user when they log in.

Rails will automatically delete the information from the `session` when the user closes the browser. We can also manually remove the data if we not longer want to track it (like when the user logs out).

Let's see it! We are going to create a special form which is going to allow our authors to "log in". This is not a secure way to simulate logging in, but we are using this as our first stepping stone to creating "real" authentication, which we'll do later on. We'll allow the user to type an authors name which will "log in" as that author.

We'll need to a create a few new things in our application in order to get set up for this:
1. Create a login form and form submission route (think of how we do `new` and `create`)
2. Create a special controller for managing this login process called `SessionsController`
3. Add empty controller actions for the routes in step #1
4. Create a form view where our user will enter in the author's name
5. Create our initial controller action which will set the `session`
```ruby
# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
...
  def login
    author = Author.find_by(name: params[:name])

    if author
      session[:author_id] = author.id
    end
  end
```

6. Update the controller action to improve the user experience after they log in:
```ruby
# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
...
  def login
    author = Author.find_by(name: params[:name])

    if author
      session[:author_id] = author.id
      flash[:success] = "#{ author.name } is successfully logged in"
      redirect_to root_path
    end
  end
```

**Question**: Now where can we utilize this logged in Author information?  
**Question**: How you think you'd use the `session` in a logout action?

## Key Takeaways
Rails provides a few special hash-like objects that allow us to go above and beyond local and instance variables in our Rails applications.

We will utilize `flash` and `flash.now` to provide additional feedback to our users as they use our applications.

We will utilize `session` to keep track of logged in user information.

### Table of Rails Hash-like Objects

| Name        | Data Comes From                    | Available |
|:------------|:-----------------------------------|:----------|
| `flash`     | This or the last controller action | The rest of this request cycle and the next complete request cycle |
| `flash.now` | This controller action. Adds to the `flash` from the last cycle, but will not be carried over to the next one. | The rest of this request cycle (in `flash`) |
| `session`   | Some controller action             | Until the user closes the broswer |
| `params`    | The request (URL or body)          | The corresponding request cycle   |
